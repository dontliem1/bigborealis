  concept_start: The big bang spawned the planets and the universe – but why was it
    all created if there was nobody to discover it, to feel it, to experience it?
    There was one piece of the puzzle missing…

  genius_text: 'The Genius: Leonardo explored the world around him through science,
    art and intuition. Humankind was not created just to mark time, he realised, but
    also to invent, create and aspire to achieve knowledge.'
  quote_1: "«There are three classes of people: those who see, those who see when
    they are shown, those who do not see», — Leonado Da Vinci"
  concept_story: Almost 80 million real pixels, 4 km of cabling and more than 350,000
    projected lumens come together to create a sensory riot. In this revision of Leonardo’s
    work, the Genius Immersive Experience presents what his vision might have been
    today. How would he perceive our attitudes towards ecology, nature, science, space
    exploration and modern art? Discover the answers to our future by examining our
    past.
  quote_2: "«All our knowledge has its origins in our perceptions», — Leonado Da Vinci"
