description: The Genius Immersive Experience is a creative journey through the eyes
  of Leonardo da Vinci, as if he were alive today. It’s like nothing you’ve experienced
  ever before.
features:
  features_title: Genius is not just another show
  introduction: It’s a completely new, immersive art experience that sets the tone
    for the next generation of shows.
  next_generation: "**Next-generation.** Just as Leonardo da Vinci was ahead of his
    time, so too is this show — pushing the boundaries of visual content to astonishing
    effect. Prepare to discover something truly original."
  touch: "**Touchable & Playable.** What’s it like to be inside one of the brightest
    minds that ever existed? Interact and feel the power of human creativity, the
    light-bulb moment of invention and the cognitive workings of a Genius."
  edutainment: "**Edutainment.** Revisit Leonardo’s inventions and ideas within a
    modern framework. Find new meanings in them, reflect on your own talents and endeavours,
    and take a glimpse into the future."
  music: "**Music Experience.** Take a moment to slow down, focus on the now and tune
    into your thoughts. Give yourself up to the frisson-inducing musical score and
    interactive visuals that accompany the show, within a 360-degree soundscape."

  concept_start: The big bang spawned the planets and the universe – but why was it
    all created if there was nobody to discover it, to feel it, to experience it?
    There was one piece of the puzzle missing…

  genius_text: 'The Genius: Leonardo explored the world around him through science,
    art and intuition. Humankind was not created just to mark time, he realised, but
    also to invent, create and aspire to achieve knowledge.'
  quote_1: "«There are three classes of people: those who see, those who see when
    they are shown, those who do not see», — Leonado Da Vinci"
  concept_story: Almost 80 million real pixels, 4 km of cabling and more than 350,000
    projected lumens come together to create a sensory riot. In this revision of Leonardo’s
    work, the Genius Immersive Experience presents what his vision might have been
    today. How would he perceive our attitudes towards ecology, nature, science, space
    exploration and modern art? Discover the answers to our future by examining our
    past.
  quote_2: "«All our knowledge has its origins in our perceptions», — Leonado Da Vinci"
